# Closest-Pair
The closestpair Java program reads sets of 2D points from a file and computes the closest pair using both a divide-and-conquer approach and a brute-force method. It sorts points by coordinates, calculates distances between pairs, and outputs the closest pair's coordinates and distance, along with execution times for each set.
